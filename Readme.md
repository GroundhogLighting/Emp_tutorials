Welcome to the Emp tutorials support files repository. I hope this series help you learn and enjoy
this program.

The guide this repo is supporting is the 
[Official Emp documentation](https://groundhoglighting.gitbook.io/emp-doc/), 
so I advise you to go there in order to use these files.

The [Emp repository](https://github.com/GroundhogLighting/emp)
is available for viewing the files, downloads and more.
